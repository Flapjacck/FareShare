    """
    Ride Model - Represents a ride offer posted by a driver.
    
    When a driver posts a ride, they specify:
    - Where they're going (origin â†’ destination)
    - When they're leaving (departure time)
    - How many passengers they can take (seats)
    - How much each passenger pays (price)
    
    Uses PostGIS (PostgreSQL extension) to store geographic coordinates.
    This allows efficient queries like "find rides near me" or "within 10km radius".
    
    Relationships:
        - driver: The user who created this ride (N:1 - many rides, one driver)
        - bookings: All passenger bookings for this ride (1:N - one ride, many bookings)
        - reviews: All reviews related to this ride (1:N)
